# Dog Gallery

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.1.<br><br> This was my first time using Angular and Typescript. Coming from React I didn't know what to expect but as I continued this project I found Angular to be more intuitive and made more sense logically.<br><br>This project is using the [Dog Ceo Api](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) which was very easy and fun to use. I used Angular Material for the UI design, I've previously used Material UI with React so it felt right at home.<br><br> I used Angular's routing to create dynamic routes that change when you click on each dog breed and their sub breed.
